# Infusion in React

This repository demonstrates a strategy for using Infusion within a React app.  It was heavily influenced by
[the approach outlined in this blog post](https://medium.com/@ryoldash/customize-webpack-config-of-react-app-created-with-create-react-app-7a78c7849edc)
and one of the strategies outlined in [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45658200/how-do-i-use-include-third-party-libraries-in-react/45658201).

This app demonstrates strategies for:

1. Including Infusion in the materials packaged up by webpack.
2. Making `fluid` available as something that can be imported and used with React.
3. Writing React components that are backed by Fluid components.

This short sketch was created in support of making Infusion tools like UIO+ available with the React ecosystem.

To run this demonstration:

1. Check out this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Follow the instructions onscreen and point your browser at the development version of the React App (typically at localhost:3000).
